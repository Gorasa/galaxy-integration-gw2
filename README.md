# galaxy-integration-gw2

Guild Wars 2 integration for GOG Galaxy 2.1+ (64-bit, Windows)

Features:
* Import of the owned game and expansions (Heart of Thorns, Path of Fire, ...)
* Detection of installed and running game, launch, install and uninstall
* Import of game time and achievements

## Requirements

* GOG Galaxy 2.1 or newer (64-bit). The older 32-bit GOG Galaxy 2.0 client is not supported anymore, use version 0.5.2 for it.
* A Guild Wars 2 API key with the `account` and `progression` permissions, created at https://account.arena.net/applications

## Installation

1. Close GOG Galaxy.
2. Unpack the latest archive from https://github.com/Gorasa/galaxy-integration-gw2/releases to `%localappdata%\GOG.com\Galaxy\plugins\installed\gw2\` (replace an existing older version completely).
3. Start GOG Galaxy and connect the Guild Wars 2 integration with your API key.

## Building from source

GOG Galaxy 2.1+ runs plugins with a bundled 64-bit Python 3.13, so the third-party dependencies must be downloaded for that runtime. This requires a local Python 3.13 installation (`py -3.13` on Windows, `python3.13` elsewhere).

1. Run `download_deps.cmd` (Windows) or `download_deps.sh` (Linux/macOS). This fills `3rdparty_windows/` with the packages from `requirements.txt`.
2. Copy the repository content (without `.git`) to `%localappdata%\GOG.com\Galaxy\plugins\installed\gw2\`.

## Logs

Plugin logs are written to `%programdata%\GOG.com\Galaxy\logs\` (file name starting with `plugin-gw2-`).
